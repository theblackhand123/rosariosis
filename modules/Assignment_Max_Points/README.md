## Description

This plugin lets you set a maximum of Points for Assignments.

1. When (mass) creating or editing an Assignment, total "Points" will be forced to the maximum, no more, no less.
2. When entering Gradebook Grades, "Points" over the maximum will prevent from saving the form and an alert will be displayed to teachers.

The maximum points value apply for all teachers (and administrators), and different values can be set for each school.

Translated in French & Spanish.
