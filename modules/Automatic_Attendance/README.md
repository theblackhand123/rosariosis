## Description

This plugin will automatically take Attendance each day. Every course period will have their students marked as "Present" (or your default Attendance Code).
You can also use this plugin to manually take missing attendance for past school dates. For this, click the "Take missing attendance" link when on the plugin Configuration screen.
The plugin runs once every day on a per school basis, after the configured hour.
If you use RosarioSIS in a multi-school setup and you notice there is still missing attendance for a school, just switch to this school using the left menu and reload the page using the `F5` key.
