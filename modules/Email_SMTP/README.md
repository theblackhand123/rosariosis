## Description

Send emails using SMTP instead of the default PHP `mail()` function.
Having problems with RosarioSIS not sending emails? Use this SMTP plugin to fix your email deliverability issues.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for sending emails. SMTP helps increase email deliverability by using proper authentication. Just enter your email provider's SMTP server settings to relay emails sent by RosarioSIS.
