The /locale folder contains the localization files.
The structure of the subfolders and files must be as follow:
For example, for a french translation:

locale/
	fr_FR.utf8/
		LC_MESSAGES/
			Email_SMTP.mo
			Email_SMTP.po

Note: When inserting new strings for your module (strings that are not already present in RosarioSIS), please use the dgettext() PHP function like this:
dgettext('Email_SMTP', 'Email_SMTP text to be translated').

Note2: When creating a new translation for your module, please use the 'dgettext:2' keyword in Poedit (via Catalog > Settings > Keywords). No need to translate the strings belonging to RosarioSIS ('_' keyword).
