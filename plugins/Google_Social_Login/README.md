## Description

Google Social Login plugin for RosarioSIS. User login using Google as an external identity provider (through the **OAuth 2.0** protocol).

The user clicks the "Login with Google" link on the login screen. He is redirected to the provider login screen. Then, if authentication is successful, RosarioSIS will try to match the user email address with an existing user in RosarioSIS database and log the user in.

Note: only existing users in RosarioSIS can login. They must have a Username.

Note 2: other identity providers are available. Check these pages for [Official](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/providers/league/) and [Community](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/providers/thirdparty/) providers.

**Warning**: even after login out of RosarioSIS, you are still logged in your Google account. If you are on a public computer, go to the Google site and logout.
