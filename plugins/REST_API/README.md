## Description

This RosarioSIS plugin provides a REST API (Application Programming Interface).
Access and explore the API using the example client. Authentication is done with JWT (JSON Web Token).

It is based on the [PHP-CRUD-API](https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api) package, see `README_API.md` for more info.
Please check your server meets the minimum requirements below.

Translated in French & Spanish.

Note: to prevent database scraping, pages are limited to 1000 records.

Note 2: a user token becomes invalid when the admin user who created it has his account deleted or switched to the "No Access" profile.

## Content

Plugin Configuration
- API URL
- Authentication URL
- Example client. For example, enter `records/access_log` in the "API Call" to list (GET) the `access_log` table entries.
