## Description

This RosarioSIS plugin shows a listing of a student's brothers and sisters (siblings) and parents. That is to say, students who are associated to the same parent(s) user. Consult the "Relatives" tab from the _Student Info_ program.

Note: You can translate the "Relatives" tab and add fields to it using the _Students > Student Fields_ program.
